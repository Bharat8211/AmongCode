# Image Compression with K-means
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
We are implementing a simple Machine Learning algorithm known as 
K-means to compress a image.This technique can also be used for image compression. 
Every colour image is made up with 3 colour values which are R(Red), G(Green) and B(Blue).
In this case, we can implement K-means to reduce colour density of an image by taking average K amount of
colours that look closest to the given image.
### Prerequisites
* Numpy: 
Install Numy by running this command: ```pip3 install numpy```
* Pillow
Install Numy by running this command: ```pip3 install pillow```

### Steps to Execute the program
* After you've this repository on your local machine, 
get yourself a image and add it to the ```Image Compression``` folder.
* Add the image path to  ```image_path ``` variable on Line 52 of the program and run the program.
* To play around and get different results, chnage ```K``` value on Line 66.
